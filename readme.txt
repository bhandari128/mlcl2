For an end-user, this app should offer a Command Line Interface (CLI) to a simple Machine Learning App.

If you are the administrator, you should rely on Bash and Python to administer the app.

To install this app, follow the instructions listed below:

- Obtain a Linux host or Linux Virtual Machine.

- If you are familiar with VirtualBox, the ova-file listed below should provide a nice Linux Virtual Machine:
  - https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B32INV-pzunwazA4UDdLUjFVQjA/view?usp=sharing
  - After you boot the above machine, the password is 'a'
  - The above machine has anaconda python installed inside the ann account.

- If you want to use your own Linux host rather than the above Virtual Machine, I suggest you create an account called 'ann' and use that account to own the app.

- If you are new to Linux, I suggest you learn Linux as you learn about this app:
  - If you have Linux questions, get an account on StackOverflow, and ask questions.
  - Dont let lack of Linux knowledge slow you down as you wrestle with this app.

- After you login, you should see if Anaconda Python is installed already with this shell command:
  - ~/anaconda3/bin/python

- If Anaconda is not installed, you should install it because this app depends on Anaconda:
